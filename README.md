# Console-Based-Chess

The console-based chess game was the project of my Programming Fundamental course. This game was written in C++ under the concept of functional programming. 

It has the following functionalities:
  * Chess Logic/Rules/General functionalities of the program
  * Saving/Loading three different games
  * Timing the game
  * Console-Based Interface

If you are interested in playing chess, here is a list of chess rules: https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess

I am attaching the detailed pdf document, named "chess.pdf" for better understanding. This document explains all the requirements required to fulfill. 

If you want to know how you can develop a GUI based chess game with OOP concepts, you can visit the following repository:
https://github.com/farhana1i/Chess-SFML

# Instructions:

    * Open any IDE(recommend: Visual Studio 2019) to run C++ program.
    * Create a new project.
    * Create a new .cpp file and name it "main.cpp".
    * From the repository, click src->chess.cpp, copy the whole code.
    * Paste in the newly created "main.cpp" file.
    * Press ctrl+F5(in my case) to execute the program.

Now, you can enjoy the game.

If you find any bug or want to update/add some extra functionalities, kindly inform me by pulling a merge request. If you don't know how to use GitHub, in that case, email me at rhan.fa.a1i@gmail.com.

Best of luck!
